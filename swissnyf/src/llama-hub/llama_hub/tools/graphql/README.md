# GraphQL Tool

This tool provides agents the ability to easily execute GraphQL queries against a server. The tool can be initialized with the server url and any required headers and thereafter perform queries against the server

## Usage

This tool has a more extensive example usage documented in a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/tools/notebooks/graphql.ipynb)

Here's an example usage of the GraphQLToolSpec.

This tool works best when the Agent has access to the GraphQL schema for the server. See [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/tools/notebooks/shopify.ipynb) for an example of using a tool with a file loader to create even more powerful Agents.

```python
from llama_hub.tools.graphql import GraphQLToolSpec
from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAgent

tool_spec = GraphQLToolSpec(
  url = 'https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/',
  headers = {
      'content-type': 'application/json',
  }
)

agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tool_spec.to_tool_list())

agent.chat('get the id, model, name and type of the Ships from the graphql endpoint')
```

`graphql_request`: Runs a GraphQL query against the configured server

This loader is designed to be used as a way to load data as a Tool in a Agent. See [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main) for examples.
