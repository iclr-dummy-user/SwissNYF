# Azure Speech Tool

This tool allows Agents to use Microsoft Azure speech services to transcribe audio files to text, and create audio files from text. To see more and get started, visit https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-speech

## Usage

This tool has a more extensive example usage documented in a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/tools/notebooks/azure_speech.ipynb)

```python
from llama_hub.tools.azure_speech import AzureSpeechToolSpec
from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAgent

speech_tool = AzureSpeechToolSpec(
    speech_key='your-key',
    region='eastus'
)

agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(
    speech_tool.to_tool_list(),
    verbose=True,
)
print(agent.chat('Say "hello world"'))
print(agent.chat('summarize the data/speech.wav audio file into a few sentences'))
```

`text_to_speech`: Takes an input string and synthesizes audio to play on the users computer
`speech_to_text`: Takes a .wav file and transcribes it into text

This loader is designed to be used as a way to load data as a Tool in a Agent. See [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main) for examples.
